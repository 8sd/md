# `md` - Use Markdown in HTML

To use `md` first import [`marked`](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) and afterwards `md`.

After including `md` one can use markdown in html like this:

```html
<body>
  <md>
    `markdown`
  </md>
</body>
```

For examples see the `index.html` which is a demo file.
